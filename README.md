Use Neural Networks to learn Slime Volleyball

1. Open up the project in Eclipse.
2. navigate to src -> neuralnetwork.neuroevolution -> Neuroevolution.java
3. Train an AI by clicking the run button at the top.
4. The training outputs the configuration of the best network every 25 iterations.
5. Let it train for ~100 iterations and then close the training window. Might take a few
minutes depending on the setup of your machine.
6. navigate to src -> neuralnetwork.neuroevolution -> SlimeAgent.java
7. Click run at the top. This will load the best configuration of an AI player that we just trained
8. Enjoy!
